# Reproducibility supplement for "Multivariate Symmetry: Distribution-Free Testing via Optimal Transport"

This repository contains codes to reproduce the results in the paper "Multivariate Symmetry: Distribution-Free Testing via Optimal Transport".

`OTsymm_simulations.ipynb` contains the codes to reproduce results in the simulation studies.

`OT_symm_real_data.ipynb` contains the codes to reproduce results in the real data example.

The codes can be run on a local laptop (MacBook Pro with 2.4 GHz Intel Core i5, 16GB memory).
